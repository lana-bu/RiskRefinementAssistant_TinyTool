        <p class = "indented-paragraph">Within the context of a software development project,
            a risk is any possible future event that could negatively impact the software project.
            This could be in regards to the project schedule, product quality, customer satisfaction, or
            many other factors. Unexpected future events, changes to the software requirements, and
            choices made by the project team can all risk the success of the project in some way.
        </p>
        <p class = "indented-paragraph">Risks can be fairly minor, perhaps only causing a few days of delay
            in the project schedule, or they can be catastrophically major, causing the entire project
            to fail, or any level in between. They also range in likelihood of occurring, some
            being very probable while others are only a small chance. As many risks as
            possible should be identified for a software project, but considering limited time
            and resources, only a certain number, valued first based on high probability and second based on 
            dangerous effects, should be selected for further analysis and development of risk mitigation, monitoring
            and management strategies.
