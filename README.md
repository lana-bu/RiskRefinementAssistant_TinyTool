# RiskRefinementAssistant_TinyTool
## Description
This web application is a risk refinement assistant. It will take the condition(s) and consequence of a user's risk and formulate it into a refined risk sentence. We are creating this web app for our final project in the CIS 375 (Software Engineering I) at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.
