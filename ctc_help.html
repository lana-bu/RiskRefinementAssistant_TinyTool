        <p class = "indented-paragraph">The condition-transition-consequence (CTC) format is a
            to refine a project risk by structuring it in a clear sentence that states all of
            the relevant details of the risk, namely the condition(s) and consequence. The CTC
            sentence format is as follows:
            <br/>
            <div class="ctc-example">
                <i>Given that [condition or subconditions], then there is concern that (possibly) [consequence].</i>
            </div>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">The condition describes the situation or context that could
            lead to a risk event. Depending on how complicated the risk is, the condition could be
            further refined into two or more subconditions to provide more detail to what exactly is
            causing the risk. The transition simply directs the sentence from the condition or subcondition
            statements into the consequence. The consequence details the potential impact or outcome on the
            project if the risk event occurs.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">One example of how to use the CTC format can be exemplified with the
            general risk of not completing a product by deployment date. This can happen for a multitude of
            reasons, but let's assume the concern for this project is caused by an inexperienced development
            team. We can use the CTC format to refine the risk as follows:
            <br/>
            <div class="ctc-example">
                <i>Given that the project's software development team lacks experience, then there is concern that (possibly) the product will not be delivered by the customer's deadline.</i>
            </div>
            <br/>
            We can further refine the condition of the risk into two subconditions: one having to do with the
            team consisting of many new members who haven't gotten the chance to work together much, and one
            having to do with the team's general lack of knowledge around designing the certain type of product
            requested by the customers.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <div class="ctc-example">
                <i>Given that the project's software development team has not yet found a comfortable team workflow and is unfamiliar with the type of product being designed, then there is concern that (possibly) the product will not be delivered by the customer's deadline.</i>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Using the CTC format to refine our risk has allowed us to clearly state the details of the risk and
            the potential cause and effect relation between certain project conditions and an unwanted consequence.
            Now we know what conditions are creating this risk, and we can develop ways to prevent and deal with the
            risk early on in the project so that we can avoid the negative outcome and, in the worst case scenario where
            it happens anyway, know what to do to keep it from getting worse.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <p class="indented-paragraph">The benefit of refining your risks with the CTC format is making them
            easier to analyze. It encourages you to explicitly state all the project conditions which may lead
            to a certain consequence. Making these known means you can develop effective mitigation, monitoring,
            and managing strategies for all aspects of the risk.
